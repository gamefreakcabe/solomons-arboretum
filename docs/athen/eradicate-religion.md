# Eradication of Religion in Public Space
## How did we get here?
- Supreme Court 1962 – Engle v. Vital – they threw prayer out of school
- Within 12 months threw the Bible out of schools
- Overturned over 200 years of practice with no precedent because the Supreme Court said so.
- SCOTUS came up with the LEMON test – brand new test
	- LEMON TEST – any religious activity must have an overriding secular purpose
	- LEMON TEST cited 7000 times over 50 years to eradicate religious expression from public and government spaces.
