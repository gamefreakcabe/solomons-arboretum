# Athenaeum

## Summary

History is one of the most difficult subject. The longer that time pass, the harder teaching history becomes. As such, many education institutions resort to "bullet point" history, which lead to a very narrow view of history. Keeping in the tradition of ancient Rome, the Athenaeum is a library of research papers to uncommonly known subjects.
