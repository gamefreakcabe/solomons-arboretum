## Origin

Solomon's Arboretum started in 2025 as a response to the shift in society where political and nihilistic ideology were becoming the more important than principles. The goal of the Arboretum is to design, build, and publish more principle pieces of work ranging from research papers to fictional pieces of work. Principle ideas should be planted, allow to grow, study in detail, record the findings, and pass along to others.
