## Origin

Solomon's Arboretum started in 2025 as a response to the shift in society where political and nihilistic ideology were becoming the more important than principles. The goal of the Arboretum is to design, build, and publish more principle pieces of work ranging from research papers to fictional pieces of work. Principle ideas should be planted, allow to grow, study in detail, record the findings, and pass along to others.

## [Athenaeum](./athen/index.md)

History is one of the most difficult subject. The longer that time pass, the harder teaching history becomes. As such, many education institutions resort to "bullet point" history, which lead to a very narrow view of history. Keeping in the tradition of ancient Rome, the Athenaeum is a library of research papers to uncommonly known subjects.
